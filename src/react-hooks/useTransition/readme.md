# useTransition Hook

The useTransition hook in React is used to manage state transitions that may take a bit longer to complete (like heavy computations or network requests), without blocking the UI or making the user feel like the app is unresponsives

- Non-blocking UI: 
Ensures that the UI stays responsive by allowing the urgent updates to be processed immediately, while the less urgent ones are deferred.

- Optimized for slow UI transitions: 
Useful for scenarios like filtering large lists, fetching data, or complex animations that take time to complete.
- isPending state: 
Indicates whether a transition is in progress. This helps in showing loading states or UI feedback while the transition is happening.


const [isPending, startTransition] = useTransition();


- For filtering or sorting large datasets.
- For slow network requests or API calls.
- For animations or transitions that might take time to complete.
- When updating UI elements that donâ€™t need to be immediately reflected on the screen, but you still want them to be processed in the background.
