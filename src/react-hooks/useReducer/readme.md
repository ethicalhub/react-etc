# useReducer Hook

useReducer is a React hook used for managing state in more complex situations, where state transitions depend on previous state values or involve more complex logic. It is an alternative to useState and is especially useful when state logic becomes intricate or involves multiple sub-values.

When to use useReducer
- When state updates depend on previous state values.
- For complex state logic (e.g., multiple actions, conditions).
- When managing state across multiple components or actions.
- In cases where state updates are more predictable or require actions with specific effects.

the code attached is just the basic implementation, which I might/might not update later with more complex logic
