# useId Hook

The useId hook in React is used to generate unique IDs for elements that can be used in scenarios where elements need to be uniquely identified within a component or across the application. It ensures that the generated ID is consistent across renders and that it works well with server-side rendering (SSR).

This hook is particularly useful for cases where you need to associate form elements with labels or other elements requiring unique identifiers, such as checkboxes, radio buttons, or accessibility features like ARIA labels.

- Uniqueness: 
The ID generated by useId is unique to the component instance.
- Consistency: 
The generated ID will be the same across re-renders of the component.
- Works with SSR: 
Unlike manually generated IDs, useId ensures the IDs are consistent during server-side rendering.
