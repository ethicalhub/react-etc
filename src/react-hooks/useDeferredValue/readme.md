# useDeferredValue hook

- The useDeferredValue hook is a React hook that allows you to defer updates to a value, especially when dealing with expensive calculations or operations.
- It allows you to defer the re-render of certain parts of the UI until the next available time. This is particularly useful for non-urgent state updates, such as those caused by user input or network requests.

- useDeferredValue takes a value and returns a deferred version of that value.
- When the value updates, React will try to apply the deferred value gradually, reducing the UI's lag during heavy updates.

- useDeferredValue: 
The hook is used to create a deferred version of the query value. This helps to prevent the search operation from blocking UI updates and improves responsiveness.

Filtering Items: 
The list of items is filtered based on the deferred value, which means React will gradually update the UI with the filtered results rather than - re-rendering immediately with each keystroke.

- Input and UI Performance: 
As the user types, the input field updates immediately, but the expensive filtering operation (which involves searching through the list) is deferred, reducing the UI jank.
